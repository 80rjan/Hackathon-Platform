For the Skopje-Code hackathon organized at Start-Up Club Skopje, my team and I identified a common challenge faced by many students today: finding hackathons is often a difficult and frustrating task. Most students discover these events randomly, through Instagram stories or LinkedIn posts, but there is no centralized platform to easily explore and apply for hackathons. Additionally, the process of applying is outdated, often involving basic Google Forms that make it hard to connect with the right opportunities and teams.

To solve this problem, we created the Hackathon Arena – a modern, dynamic platform designed to simplify and streamline the hackathon experience. The Hackathon Arena connects two types of users: organizers and participants.

Organizers can set up and manage hackathons with customizable features like varying difficulty levels, free or paid participation, team size limits, and more. For paid hackathons, participants can pay directly when applying for the event, eliminating the need for organizers to collect payments from each group on the day of the hackathon. This not only makes payment collection seamless but also saves organizers time and effort.

Participants can easily browse a wide range of hackathons, filter events by type, difficulty, or prize, and find opportunities that best match their interests. They can also connect with other participants, build teams, and join hackathons together. Additionally, the platform allows users to add friends, creating a supportive and collaborative community.

Hackathon Arena makes it easy for students to find and join hackathons, eliminating the random and often unreliable search process. It transforms the participation process into something seamless, social, and intuitive, making hackathons more accessible and enjoyable for everyone involved.

With Hackathon Arena, the future of hackathon participation is modern, organized, and built around community – all in one easy-to-use platform.
